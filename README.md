Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection System for Visually Impaired

This project uses three ultrasonic sensors placed at left, center,
and right directions to detect obstacles and provide vibration-based
feedback to blind users.

Hardware Used:
- Arduino Nano
- 3 Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
- 3 Vibration Motors

Language:
- Embedded C (Arduino)
